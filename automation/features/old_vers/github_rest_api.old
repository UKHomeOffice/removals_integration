Feature: Let's make some POST calls to RemovalsAPI & see what happens
 As someone who loves and cherishes the RemovalsAPI 
 I want to send data (JSON) to the RemovalsAPI
 So that it will bring smile for behat community

Scenario Outline: updating data by sending JSON
    When I post the following JSON to "/update-centres":
    """
    {
        "totals" : 
        {
            "date" : "27-2-2015",
            "time" : "08:02:37",
            "bed_counts": 
            {
                "Harmondsworth" : 
                {
                    "male" :  <value_male>,
                    "female" :  <value_female>,
                    "out_of_commission": <value_ooc>
                }                
            }
        }
    }
    """
    Then the status code should be 200
    When I go to "http://localhost/dashboard"
    Then I should see <expected_male> in the "div#harmondsworth div.bed_data span.male" element
    Then I should see <expected_female> in the "div#harmondsworth div.bed_data span.female" element
    Then I should see <expected_ooc> in the "div#harmondsworth div.bed_data span.ooc" element        
    Examples:
    | value_male| expected_male     |value_female   |expected_female  | value_ooc | expected_ooc |
    | 0         | "0"               |0              |"0"              | 0         |  "0"         |
    | 20        | "20"              |100            |"100"            | 50        |  "50"        |
    | 200       | "200"             |99             |"99"             | 12        |  "12"        |
